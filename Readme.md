# :notebook: Brain Dump

- This is a command line tool that allows you to dump all your brain thoughts in a text file.
- I must say that this script isn't originally built by me, I borrowed the idea and the scirpt from [Nick Janetakis](https://github.com/nickjj/notes), you should check out his [Github](https://github.com/nickjj) page and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCorzANoC3fX9VVefJHM5wtA) channel he has some really good content.
- So about the tool, everyone has their own way of note tacking, and for me well I thought I should try and edit the tool to my likeness then I went overboard and also renamed the tool from notes to braindump, no hard feeling nick.
- So I won't get into the small stuff explaining how the tool works, but their is a video below that will show you how it works apart from the installation bit.

## :toolbox: Installation

- Again I borrowed this from nick ...

- Copy paste the below one liner to set it up.

```bash
# Basically the one liner gets the script outputs it in the /usr/local/bin
# folder and gives it execution rights allowing you to call the script
# from anywhere within your directory

sudo curl \
  -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iAmG-r00t/braindump/master/braindump \
  -o /usr/local/bin/braindump && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/braindump

```
